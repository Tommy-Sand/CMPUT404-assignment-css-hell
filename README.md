Changes made to Gutenberg pages
=================
I added a yellowish paper colour, #E0C9A6, as the background and the text colour became, #1F3659, a darker shade of blue. I also added 20% to the margins on both sides to move the text closer to the centre, however most pages already had this.

I gave the images a border

I increased paragraph font size and line height. I indented each paragraph.

A few other css classes were added to centre the text.
